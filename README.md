Hi! this is a platformer with 5 levels made in godot. The goal is to reach the end without falling, and if you die you have to restart at level 1. A little bird told me that.. some fish would help you on your journey? Made because games are fun and cool, also for the athena award :) [![Athena Award Badge](https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url=https%3A%2F%2Faward.athena.hackclub.com%2Fapi%2Fbadge)](https://award.athena.hackclub.com?utm_source=readme)
